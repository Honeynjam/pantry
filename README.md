# Pantry

A fast, keyboard-first, open-source (MIT) issue tracker for 1–3 person teams working with AI coding agents.
Your agents read and update issues over MCP; your data lives in your own Vercel and Convex accounts.

> Status: early development (milestone M3: shortcuts, command palette, optimistic updates, My issues and filters, on spaces with optional projects). The Deploy button below is
> being tested on a fresh account.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhoneynjam%2Fpantry&project-name=pantry&repository-name=pantry&root-directory=apps%2Fweb&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22convex%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22convex%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%7D%5D)

## Deploy your own (about 5 minutes)

You need a GitHub account. Vercel and Convex accounts are created along the way (both free for personal use;
Vercel Hobby is for non-commercial use).

1. **Click "Deploy with Vercel"** above and sign in to Vercel with GitHub.
2. **Repository:** Vercel copies this repo into your GitHub account (a clone, not a fork). Keep the name or change it.
3. **Root Directory** is already set to `apps/web` by the button; leave it, and leave the build and install
   settings alone (`apps/web/vercel.json` provides the build command). If the form shows the repo root instead,
   click **Edit** next to Root Directory and pick `apps/web`. If it's missed, the first build stops with a
   message telling you how to fix it in Settings.
4. **Add the Convex integration** when Vercel asks (it's pre-selected by the button): accept the terms and create a
   new Convex project. Keep both **Production** and **Preview** enabled and leave **Custom Prefix** empty.
   This gives the build a `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`.
5. **Deploy.** The build deploys your Convex functions, creates a `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` on your Convex deployment
   (once; it survives redeploys), points Convex `SITE_URL` at your production URL, and builds the web app.
6. **Open your production URL** (`https://<project>.vercel.app`). You'll see the setup screen: create your
   account and workspace. You become the owner; from then on sign-up is invite-only.
7. **Onboarding** starts right after: say whether you work on products, clients or both (the sidebar and the
   new-space dialog follow; change it later in Settings → General), name your first products or clients (the
   sample `PAN` space can be renamed while it's unused), invite people, connect your agent, and pick a theme.
   Everything but the first step can be skipped. Settings → General → **Run setup again** walks it again.
8. **Invite your partner** (in onboarding, or later in Settings → Members): enter their email → **Create invite
   link**, and send the link yourself (nothing is emailed). It works once, for that email address, for 7 days.
   They create their account from the link (or sign in, if they already have one on this instance) and get a
   short onboarding of their own.

If the setup screen says **"One more step"**, the deploy key wasn't allowed to set environment variables. Copy the
one-line command it shows (run it from `packages/backend` in a clone, with `--prod`), or add `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
in the Convex dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, then reload.

Only production deploys run (preview builds are skipped by `ignoreCommand` in `apps/web/vercel.json`), so previews
never touch your Convex data. Every push to your repo's production branch redeploys web + Convex together.

### Connect your agents (MCP)

1. In the app, open **Settings → API tokens** (or the user menu → API tokens), name a token after where it will
   live ("Claude Code on my laptop") and create it. You see it once.
2. Paste the snippet the screen shows. Claude Code:
   `claude mcp add --transport http pantry https://<your-app>/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`.
   Cursor: the `mcp.json` snippet, which reads the token from `PANTRY_TOKEN`.
3. Tell the agent "work on PAN-12". It reads the issue and the space's context doc, moves the issue itself, comments
   and adds sub-issues. Everything shows under your name, tagged "via MCP".

4. Agents can also organise work: "set up a space for Acme with Website and Launch projects and file these
   issues" works too. They call `get_workspace` first to see what exists.

The agent acts as you, inside your workspace only, and can do what a member can in the app, except deleting
spaces, comments or labels, archiving spaces, adding or removing statuses, and invites, members or tokens. It can
delete an issue only by repeating its key (`delete_issue { key, confirm }`), and is told to ask you first.
Revoking a token on the same screen stops it at once (the next call gets a 401). Tools (spec §10b):

- Issues: `get_issue`, `list_issues`, `search_issues`, `create_issue`, `create_sub_issue`, `add_comment`,
  `update_issue`, `delete_issue`
- Orientation and context: `get_workspace`, `get_space_context`, `update_space_context`
- Organising: `create_space`, `update_space`, `create_project`, `update_project`, `archive_project`,
  `unarchive_project`, `create_label`, `update_status`, `reorder_statuses`

Archived projects can be restored in Space settings → Projects → Archived (or with `unarchive_project`). Issues
that were in a project when it was archived stay without one.

`GET https://<your-app>/api/instance` returns `{ name, convexUrl, convexSiteUrl, serverVersion, minAppVersion,
needsSecret }`; it's the quickest health check.

### Updating your instance

The Deploy button copies this repo into your account; it doesn't fork it, so GitHub has no "Sync fork" button for
it. Your copy includes a **Sync upstream** workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`) for that. Every Monday,
or whenever you run it, it opens a pull request in your repo that updates it to the latest Pantry release.
**Merging the PR deploys the update** (Vercel rebuilds the web app and pushes the new Convex functions). Nothing
changes until you merge: the workflow never merges by itself. To skip a release, close its PR; the workflow won't
reopen it.

1. **One-time setting:** in your repo, Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions, turn on **"Allow GitHub
   Actions to create and approve pull requests"**. Without it the workflow pushes its branch but can't open the PR.
2. **Run it now (optional):** Actions → Sync upstream → Run workflow. Leave "tag" empty for the latest release, or
   tick "dry run" to see what it would do without pushing anything.
3. **Review and merge** the "Update Pantry to vX.Y.Z" PR.

Good to know:

- **The first update replaces files.** Your copy and Pantry don't share git history, so the first PR takes the
  release's files as they are. If you edited files yourself, those edits show up in its diff as removed; put
  them back on the PR branch before merging. After that the histories are linked, and later updates are normal
  merges that keep your changes (GitHub shows any conflicts in the PR).
- **Releases that change `.github/workflows`.** GitHub won't let the built-in token push changes to workflow
  files, and the run then fails with an error that says so. Fix: create a fine-grained personal access token for
  this repo only, with _Contents_, _Pull requests_ and _Workflows_ set to read and write. Save it as the repository
  secret `SYNC_UPSTREAM_TOKEN` and run the workflow again; it uses that token whenever the secret exists.
- PRs opened with the built-in token don't trigger other workflows, so CI doesn't run on them. Vercel still
  deploys once you merge.
- GitHub pauses scheduled workflows in repos with no activity for 60 days. Re-enable it on the Actions tab, or
  just run it by hand.
- Prefer a real fork? Fork the repo first and import the fork into Vercel. The same workflow works there too.
- In `honeynjam/pantry` itself the workflow does nothing.

Maintainers can test the workflow locally (no Docker; throwaway repos and a stub `gh`):
`bash scripts/test-sync-upstream.sh`.

## Develop locally

Requirements: Node 24 (`nvm use`), pnpm 10 (`corepack enable` or `npm i -g pnpm@10`). No Convex account needed.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev                       # local Convex backend (no login) + web on http://localhost:3000
```

The first time, give the local Convex deployment its two auth settings (local deployment only):

```bash
cd packages/backend
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
npx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

Then open http://localhost:3000: the setup screen creates your account and workspace.

- `pnpm dev` runs `convex dev` with `CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous` (a local backend on 127.0.0.1:3210/3211). Set
  `CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=` (empty) to use your own Convex dev deployment instead. If those ports are taken (another
  local Convex project), run it on others from `packages/backend`:
  `CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous npx convex dev --local-cloud-port 3260 --local-site-port 3261`.
- Data migrations run by themselves: `pnpm dev` runs `migrations:run` when it starts, and every Vercel deploy runs it
  right after `convex deploy`. To run them by hand: `pnpm --filter @pantry/backend migrate`. How schema changes and
  migrations work (and how to recover if one fails): [docs/MIGRATIONS.md](docs/MIGRATIONS.md).
- The web app reads the Convex URLs that `convex dev` writes to `packages/backend/.env.local` (`CONVEX_URL` or, when
  it finds Vite installed, `VITE_CONVEX_URL`), so there's nothing to copy. `apps/web/.env.local` overrides them.
- To run a second web dev server from the same folder (Next allows one per build directory), give it its own
  directory: `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-2 pnpm --filter @pantry/web exec next dev --port 3001`. If you sign in there,
  set `SITE_URL` to that origin.

### Checks (what CI runs)

```bash
pnpm check   # format check, typecheck, lint, tests, web build
pnpm fix     # format and auto-fix lint
```

### Design system review page

`packages/ui` holds the tokens, theme provider, motion tokens and components. A dev-only page shows all of them in
light and dark: open http://localhost:3000/design while `pnpm dev` runs. Production builds return 404 for `/design`
unless `PANTRY_DESIGN_PAGE=1` is set at build time.

### Landing site

`apps/site` is the one-page marketing site (http://localhost:3002 while `pnpm dev` runs). All copy lives in
`apps/site/lib/content.ts`. It's deployed as its own Vercel project, separate from any Pantry instance:
import this repo again, set **Root Directory** to `apps/site`, don't add Convex, then add the domain under
Settings → Domains. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (e.g. `https://pantry.dev`) for canonical URLs and social cards; without
it the site uses Vercel's production URL. `apps/site/vercel.json` skips builds when nothing the site depends on changed.
