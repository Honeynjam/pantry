# syncs into the Vercel project. Don't run it locally against a real deployment.

#   1. Make sure the Convex deployment has BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generated once, never printed).
#   2. Point Convex SITE_URL at this Vercel project's production URL.
#   3. `convex deploy`: build apps/web with the Convex URLs, typecheck, push functions/schema.
#   4. Data migrations (scripts/migrate.sh --prod): move existing rows to the new layout. A failure
#      fails the build; it's safe to re-run (docs/MIGRATIONS.md).
