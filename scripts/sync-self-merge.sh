# Merges an "Update Pantry" PR that Sync upstream marked for self-merge, once CI has passed on its head commit.
# This is automatic updates (SYNC_AUTO_MERGE) where GitHub's own auto-merge isn't available, e.g. private repos
# on GitHub Free. Called by .github/workflows/sync-upstream-merge.yml when a CI run completes, and once by
# sync-upstream.yml right after it marks the PR (in case CI already finished).
#
# Merges only when all of these hold, and otherwise leaves the PR open (with a comment when it's stuck):
#   - an open PR from a sync-upstream/* branch in this repo has this commit as its head;
#   - its description carries Sync upstream's marker for this exact commit (so a push by anyone else after
#     the bot's stops it);
#   - every run of the CI workflow on the commit has completed, and all of them succeeded;
#   - GitHub says it merges cleanly.
# It merges with a merge commit (the next update then merges cleanly) and only if the head is still this commit.
#
#   GH_TOKEN=<SYNC_UPSTREAM_TOKEN> GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo bash scripts/sync-self-merge.sh <head sha>
# The token's merge starts other workflows (Vercel deploys, Watch update deploys) like a merge by a person.
